# React-Employee-Directory

Here is my employee directory created by react. When you type letters in the search bar, it will limit the amount of people in the directory. In total there are 100 people within a data.json database. You can also search for people from Z-A by hitting the Name, Email, Phone number, or Nationality Tab so it "Decends" to the very bottom of the order and you can also "Acend" the date to the top from A-Z.
